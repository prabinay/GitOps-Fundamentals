Introduction to Argo Rollouts
Argo Rollouts is a progressive delivery controller created for Kubernetes. It allows you to deploy your application with minimal/zero downtime by adopting a gradual way of deploying instead of taking an “all at once” approach.

Argo Rollouts supercharges your Kubernetes cluster and in addition to the rolling updates you can now do:

Blue/green deployments
Canary deployments
A/B tests
Automatic rollbacks
Integrated Metric analysis

Let’s see how this works in practice.
